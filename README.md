# Overview

This is a client sever program where the client can send items to the sever, and when requested, the server will send the list of items back to the user. 
I created this program to learn about networking between sever and client.
In order to run this program you will need to run the server file first, then, in a seperate terminal run the client file. it then will print a menu of how to use program.
